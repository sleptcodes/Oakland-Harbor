FOR PLAYERS:

Who knew the shipping business was so ruthless!? 

With this simulation, one can spawn in as many boats as they like. Each 
boat spawned is tasked with dropping off its cargo at a dock. A boat will 
auto-locate the dock with the least boats going to it and set that dock as 
its destination. Boats can come from three spawns: the Pacific Ocean, 
Valleijo, or San Jose.

Woah but it ain't that easy. A pirate can spawn at the user's discretion.
The pirate will auto-locate the nearest boat with cargo. If the pirate 
catches the boat, the cargo is stolen and the boat sunken.

CHALLENGE: Try to spawn boats in a way such that, over time more cargo is 
           dropped off than stolen.
           (hint, exploit the pirate's ai... a loss is okay as long as
           victories are more frequent)

MOUSE PICKING: If the user clicks on a boat, it will turn into a clown!
This function is purely cosmetic.

LIMITATIONS:

My Model(data) lies within my View(Bay), as oppose to along side it in Main. 
 - There is no appaernt issue with this in functionality, but it limits the 
   modularity of my code... I could always change it, but I would need to 
   update how my information is passed along (I would need to initialize 
   data prior to bay, and include data in the constructor for bay)... 
 - I think the reason I initially chose the route I chose is simply because it 
   makes my main() function more compact and simplified... hiding the data 
   structure from whoever writes the main() function... 

A graphic of my memory flow:

        \          /   
         -> Bay <--        
            ^
